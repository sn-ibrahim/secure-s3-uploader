# S3 Secure Upload (Python + Boto3)
This project securely uploads files to Amazon S3 using the Boto3 SDK in Python. It ensures that your files are uploaded directly to your S3 bucket using secure credentials and best practices.
## Features
- Secure upload of local files to Amazon S3  
- Uses AWS IAM credentials with least privilege  
- Handles MIME types and file size (if implemented)  
- Clean, minimal, and efficient Python script  
- Easy integration into larger Python projects or automations  
## Tech Stack
- Language: Python 3  
- AWS SDK: Boto3  
- Storage: Amazon S3  
- Security: IAM Role/User with limited `s3:PutObject` permission  
## How It Works
1. The Python script takes a file from your local system  
2. Boto3 uses your AWS credentials to authenticate  
3. The file is uploaded directly to the specified S3 bucket and path  
4. IAM policies ensure secure access control
